To compile the tracer code, you need to do the following.

- make sure everything is compiled (run make)
- switch to ocaml 4.02
  opam switch 4.02.0+trunk
  eval `opam config env`
- create a settings.sh file with this inside
  KEEP_DEPENDS=1
- delete the compiled caml files
  make clean_cm
- build the tracer
  make interp/run_jstrace

If you run this program (with arguments identical to those of run_js),
it generates a trace.log file.

To use it, you need to transform it in the correct JavaScript
environment.

  cd tracer
  make generate.out
  cd ..
  tracer/generate.out trace.log tracer/trace.js interp/src/extract/JsInterpreterTrace.ml

You can then open the file navig.html in tracer and follow the
instructions there.
