There follows a list of all `TODO's left in the Coq development.

      - JsCorrectness.v:
      	Missings _post and _out lemmata for [if_not_throw] and [if_normal_continue_or_break].  That's strange that we don't need them:  are they still useful in the interpreter code?  Maybe they are just used in the unproven part.

      - JsInit.v:
      	The [[ThrowTypeError]] object should be checked.

      - JsPreliminary.v:
        Should the definitions about `prepost' operators be in JsPreliminary or in JsPrettyInterm?

      - JsPrettyInterm.v:
        I don't understand the comment ``is it just a leftover form the renaming?''.
        They are also a lot of things that need checking in this file.

      - JsPrettyRules.v:
        The following rules need checking:
            red_stat_switch_nodefault_6_abrupt
            red_stat_switch_default_A_5
            red_stat_switch_default_A_5_abrupt
            red_stat_switch_default_8_normal
            red_stat_switch_default_8_abrupt
            red_spec_build_error_2
        The two unused arguments of [stat_switch_default_5] are suspicious:  can't we remove them?
        There is a frightening special commented rule for [spec_creating_function_object_proto] in the middle of the code:  can we remove it safely?
